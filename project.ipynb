    "#### Short summary\n",
    "Lindo et al. (2010) examine the effects of academic probation on student outcomes using data from Canada. Academic probation is a university policy that aims to improve the performance of the lowest scoring students. If a student's grade point average (GPA) drops below a certain threshold, the student is placed on academic probation. The probation status serves as a warning and does not entail immediate consequences, however, if students fail to improve their grades during the following year, they face the threat of being suspended from university. In a more general sense, academic probation may offer insights into how agents respond to negative incentives and the threat of punishment in a real world context with high stakes. \n",
    "\n",
    "To estimate the causal impact of being placed on probation, Lindo et al. (2010) apply a **regression discontinuity design (RDD)** to data retrieved from three campuses at a large Canadian university. The RDD is motivated by the idea that the students who score just above the threshold for being put on academic probation provide a good counterfactual to the 'treatment group' that scores just below the threshold and is put on academic probation. \n",

    "# Identification\n",
    " \n",
    "Lindo et al. (2010) in their paper aim to evaluate how academic probation affects students, specifically their probability of dropping out of university and whether it motivates those who remain to improve their grades. Students are placed on probation if their Grade Point Average (GPA) drops below a certain threshold and face the threat of suspension if they fail to improve their GPA in the next term. Students are thus clearly separated into a treated group (who is put on probation) and an untreated group based on GPA. \n",
    "\n",
    "The causal graph below illustrates the relationship between the assignment (or _running_) variable  X, treatment D and outcome Y. While X (the GPA) directly assigns students to treatment, it may also be linked to student outcomes. Additionally, there may be observables W and unobservables U also affecting X,D and Y. There are thus multiple backdoor paths that need to be closed in order to isolate the effect academic probation. Simply controlling for the variables in question in this case does not suffice since there are unobservables that we cannot condition on. A randomized experiment could eliminate selection bias of treatment by randomly assigning probation to students. The research question evaluated in the paper constitutes a classic policy evaluation problem in economics where we try to understand the causal implications of a policy without being able to observe the counterfactual world where the policy is not administered. However, like many problems in economics a randomized experiment in this context is not possible (especially due to ethical reasons) since putting students on probation has real world consequences that can affect students for the rest of their lives.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"files/causal_graph_1111111.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 500px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Since it is not possible to randomize assignment to treatment, another method is needed to isolate the effects of academic probation on student outcomes. Lindo et al. (2010) apply a regression discontinuity design to the problem at hand, a method pioneered by Thistlethwaite and Campbell (1960) in their analysis of the effects of scholarships on student outcomes. In fact, the identification problem in Lindo et al.(2010) is quite similar to that of Thistlethwaite and Campbell (1960) as both papers evaluate the causal effects of an academic policy on student outcomes. However, while the scholarship administered to high performing students in Thistlethwaite and Campbell (1960) constitutes a positive reinforcement for these students, Lindo et al. (2010) examine the effects of a negative reinforcement or penalty on low performing students. This means that in contrast to Thistlethwaite and Campbell (1960) and many other applications of RD our treatment groups lies _below_ the cutoff and not above it. This does not change the causal inference of this model, it might be confusing to readers familiar with RD designs and should thus be kept in mind. \n",
    "\n",
    "The regression discontinuity design (RDD) relies on the assumption of local randomization, i.e. the idea that students who score just above the cutoff do not systematically differ from those who score below the cutoff and thus pose an appropriate control group for the students who are placed on probation. This identification strategy relies on the assumption that students are unable to precisely manipulate their grades to score just above or below the probation threshold. Within the neighborhood around the discontinuity threshold the RDD thus in a sense mimics a randomized experiment. \n",
    "\n",
    "To explain how the use of regression discontinuity allows Lindo et al. (2010) to identify treatment effects, I heavily draw on material provided in Lee and Lemieux (2010) and their discussion on the RDD in the potential outcomes framework. As mentioned above, for each student $i$ we can image a potential outcome where they are placed on probation $Y_i(1)$ and where they are not $Y_i(0)$ but we can never simultaneously observe both outcomes for each student. Since it is impossible to observe treatment effects at the individual level, researchers thus estimate average effects using treatment and control groups. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the RDD this potential outcomes framework translates by imagining there are two underlying relationships between the average student outcome and the assignment variable X (the students GPA), which are represented by $E[Y_i(1)|X]$ and $E[Y_i(0)|X]$. Since all students who score below the cutoff $c$ are placed on probation, we only observe $E[Y_i(1)|X]$ for those below the cutoff and $E[Y_i(0)|X]$ for those above the cutoff. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can estimate the average treatment effects by taking the difference of the conditional expectations at the cutoff if these underlying functions are continuous throughout the cutoff:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "lim_{\\epsilon \\downarrow 0}E[Y_i|X_i=c+\\epsilon] - lim_{\\epsilon \\uparrow 0} E[Y_i|X_i=c+\\epsilon] \n",
    "    = E[Y_i(1)-Y_i(0)|X=c].\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "As explained above, this _continuity assumption_ is fulfilled by the RDD because we can assume that students have _imprecise control_ over the assignment variable, their GPA. We can clearly identify the average treatment effects because there is a natural sharp cutoff at the threshold. The treatment administered to students is being confronted with the information that they are placed on probation and the subsequent threat of suspension. Being put on probation does not involve any actions by the students, in fact being assigned to the treatment group already constitutes the treatment in itself. Non-compliers thus do not pose a concern for this research design. \n",
    "\n",
    "As the theoretical framework discussed in the prior section illustrates, students on probation face the decision of dropping out or trying to improve their performance in the next term. While the estimation on effects on dropping out using the regression discontinuity design is relatively straight forward, the estimation of effects for subsequent performance adds additional challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"files/causal_graph_2222222.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 500px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The extended causal graph above illustrates how subsequent performance of students is also affect by whether a student drops out or not. This factor adds additional complexity to the estimation problem which is discussed in more detail in the respective part of the replication. \n",
    "\n",
    "Aside from the two main outcomes, Lindo et al. (2010) also examine the effects of academic probation on graduation rates of students. However, since information about student's academic process over the whole course of their studies is limited to mostly the first two years, only a reduced form analysis is possible."

    "The core motivation in the application of RD approaches is the idea, that the variation in treatment near the cutoff is random if subjects are unable to control the selection into treatment (Lee & Lemieux, 2010). This condition, if fulfilled, means the RDD is able to closely emulate a randomized experiment and allows researchers to identify the effects of treatment. \n",
    "\n",
    "For evaluating the effects of academic probation on subsequent student outcomes, the RDD is thus a valid approach only if students are not able to precisely manipulate whether they score above or below the cutoff. Lindo et al. (2010) offer multiple arguments to adress concerns about nonrandom sorting: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The study focuses on **first year students**, assuming this group of students is likely to be less familiar with the probation policy on campus. To verify their conjecture, the authors also conducted a survey in an introductory economics course which revealed that around 50 % of students were unsure of the probation cutoff at their campus. They also claim that this analysis showed no relationship between knowledge of probation cutoffs and student's grades. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The authors also point out that most first year courses span the entire year and most of the evaluation takes place at the end of the term which would make it difficult for students to purposely aim for performances slightly above the cutoff for academic probation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Finally, and most importantly, the implication of local randomization is testable. If nonrandom sorting were to be a problem, there should be a **discontinuity** in the distribution of grades at the cutoff with a disproportionate number of students scoring just above the cutoff. Figure 1 and table 2 show the (replicated) results of tests for such discontinuities."

    "The data (containing all observations within 1.2 GPA points from the cutoff) is sorted into bins of size 0.1. The bins contain their lower limit but not their upper limit. To replicate the result from Lindo et al., I calculate the frequency of each bin and then run a local linear regression with a bandwidth of 0.6 on each bin. Figure 1 shows the bins and the predicted frequency for each bin. The results show that the **distribution of grades is continuous around the cutoff**, suggesting that we can assume local randomization."
