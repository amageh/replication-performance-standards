This repository contains my replication of the results from Lindo et al. (2010) presented in the paper _"Ability, gender, and performance standards: Evidence from academic probation"_. 

The paper and original STATA code can be found in the folder _paper_, the data provided is saved in _data_ and my replication which is conducted using Python is presented in the Jupyter notebook _project.ipynb_.

### Short summary

Lindo et al. (2010) examine the effects of academic probation on student outcomes using a regression discontinuity design. The analysis is based on data from large Canadian univsersity and evaluates whether academic probation is successfull in improving the performance of low scoring students. Consistent with a model of performance standards, the authors find that being placed on probation in the first year of univsersity induces some students to drop out of school while it improves the grades of students who continue their studies. In a more general sense, academic probation can offer insights into how agents respond to negative incentives and the threat of punishment in a real world context.

### This project

In this project I replicate the results from Lindo et al. (2010) and explore the underlying causal relationships between academic probation and student outcomes. In addition the the replication, I also aim to extend the analysis and implement robustness checks for the results presented in the paper.
